# React Learning Project

Welcome to my React learning journey! This repository contains code and exercises from an industry-oriented React course.

## Description

This project serves as a practical exploration of React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. As I progress through the course, I'll be updating this repository with my code implementations and notes.

## Goals

- Gain a solid understanding of React fundamentals
- Build practical projects to reinforce learning
- Develop skills in frontend web development

## Future Plans

Once I complete this course, I aim to:
- Explore advanced React concepts
- Work on personal projects to apply my knowledge
- Contribute to open-source React projects
